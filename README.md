## Introduction

OpenEarable is designed to enable ear-based sensing applications by offering a flexible and open-source hardware platform. It incorporates a range of sensors, including a 9-axis inertial measurement unit, an ear canal pressure and temperature sensor, an inward-facing ultrasound microphone, a speaker, a push button, and a controllable RGB LED. With these features, OpenEarable provides researchers and developers with the ability to explore various application scenarios. 
For more information visit the [OpenEarable](https://open-earable.teco.edu/) website.

OpenEarable is controlled and streams sensor data via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). Audio is played from and recorded to the internal SD card. OpenEarable is compatible with the provided [dashboard](https://github.com/OpenEarable/dashboard) and [edge-ml](https://edge-ml.org/). 


## Setup

### Arduino IDE
Download and install the Arduino IDE. OpenEarable is based on the "Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense" board. Therefore, you first have to install the required dependencies in your Arduino IDE following this [Setup Guide](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-33-ble-sense).

### Arduino Libraries
The following Arduino Libraries have to be installed in your Arduino IDE by navigating to `Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries`:
- [EdgeML-Arduino](https://github.com/edge-ml/EdgeML-Arduino)
- [Adafruit_BMP280](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BMP280_Library)
- [DFRobot_BMX160](https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_BMX160)
- [ArduinoBLE](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoBLE)
- [SdFat (by Bill Greiman!)](https://github.com/adafruit/SdFat)


### SD Card Setup
In order to be compatible with the open earable library the SD card needs to be formatted with the exFAT format.
Make sure to have a sufficiently fast SD card. (Recommended SD Card: SandDisk class 10 and class A30)

### SPI Setup

The default Arduino implementation of the SPI library does not meet the required speed. To address this, optimized SPI files are provided. Follow the steps below to integrate these files into Arduino.
All referenced files can be found in the "resources" folder in the "spi_files" subfolder.

To fully integrate the optimized SPI files, changes to the Arduino Nano 33 BLE board files have to be made. Follow the steps below to accomplish this:

1. Open the Arduino IDE.

2. In the top left corner, click on "File."

3. From the dropdown menu, select "Preferences."

4. At the bottom of the new window, there is a hyperlink labeled under "More preferences can be edited directly in the file". Click on this hyperlink to access the file explorer.

5. Navigate to the following directory: `packages/arduino/hardware/mbed_nano/4.0.4/libraries`. *Please note:* If you have a different version than mbed_nano 4.0.4 installed or you don't have it installed at all, you can change or add it by navigating to `Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager`. Search for `Arduino Mbed OS Nano Boards` and install the desired version.

6. Locate the existing `SPI` library folder within this directory. It needs to be swapped with the provided folder named "SPI" in "resources/spi_files" found in this repository.

7. Similarly, navigate to the following directory: `packages/arduino/hardware/mbed_nano/4.0.4/cores/arduino/mbed/targets/TARGET_NORDIC/TARGET_NRF5x/TARGET_SDK_15_0/modules/nrfx/drivers/include`.

8. In this directory, locate the file named `nrfx_spi.h` and replace it with the provided `nrfx_spi.h` file from the `resources/spi_files` folder of this repository.

9. In the same directory, replace the `nrfx_spim.c` file with the `nrfx_spim.c` file provided under `resources/spi_files` of this repository.

### sdFat Library Setup
One of the library dependencies is the SdFat library from Bill Greiman.
This library is used to send data to the SD card.
To achieve the desired write speeds of up to 1.5Mbps the library has to be modified slighlty.

1. Go to the `Arduino/libraries` folder, locate the `SdFat` library folder and open it. (Note: typically, the Arduino libraries folder is located at `~/Documents/Arduino/libraries`)
   
3. Inside the `src` folder, replace the `SdFatConfig.h` with the provided `SdFatConfig.h` file found in the `resources/sdfat_config` folder of this repository.

## Usage
### Example
The easiest way to use open earable is with the provided App sketch. 
It can be found within Arduino under `File -> Examples-> EdgeML-Earable -> App`.


The absolute minimum needed to run the code successfully is the following:

```c++
#include "EdgeML_Earable.h"

void setup() {
  edge_ml_earable.begin();
}

void loop() {
  edge_ml_earable.update();
}
```

With this minimum sketch, all internal functionality is activated and the Open Earable becomes controllable via our [Dashboard](https://github.com/OpenEarable/dashboard), via [EdgeML](https://edge-ml.org/), and via the BLE API.

### Defaults
Since the SD card is used to facilitate the audio functionality and sensor data logging, certain file name defaults are already set in the firmware.
- Audio playback: "Play.wav"
- Audio recording: "Recording.wav"
- Date logging: "Log.csv"

Note that for the data logging ".csv" file format is used. The standardized header format is:

`ID, TIMESTAMP, Data1, Data2, Data3, Data4, Data5, Data6, Data7, Data8, Data9`

### Dashboard

The Open Earable can be directly connected to our [Dashboard](https://github.com/OpenEarable/dashboard).

### EdgeML

Open Earable is seamlessly integrated with [EdgeML](https://edge-ml.org/), an open-source and browser-based toolchain for machine learning on microcontrollers.

### BLE Specification

The following table contains the BLE specifications with the available Services and Characteristics as well as UUIDs.
The first 3 Services are from the [EdgeML-Arduino](https://github.com/edge-ml/EdgeML-Arduino) library.

Note: to configure sensors via BLE see [Sensor Configuration](#Sensor-Configuration).

## Firmware Internals

### Bootloader

OpenEarable is based on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE and uses the respective [bootloader](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-mbed/tree/main/bootloaders/nano33ble) with Mbed OS. 
Under "resources/Arduino_Nano_33_bootloader" the bootloader binary can be found as well.

### Pin Configuration

A handy header file with all the pin definition is provided. For reference look at the "Earable_Pins.h".

## Earable

The easiest way to use edge-ml is with the provided `App` sketch.

However, there are a few more functionalities.

Note: The majority of the following functions should be called BEFORE the `edge_ml_earable.begin()` function.

#### `void debug(Stream &stream)`

Set a IO stream for debugging purposes.

```c++
edge_ml_earable.debug(Serial);
```

#### `void set_sd_logging(bool enabled)`

Enables or disables SD card data logging. Recorded sensor values are automatically saved to the SD card. (enabled by default)

When enabled, Open Earable creates a ".csv" file on the SD card with a standardized header format consisting of:

`ID, TIMESTAMP, Data1, Data2, Data3, Data4, Data5, Data6, Data7, Data8, Data9`

#### `void disable_sd_logging()`

#### `void set_logger_file_name(String name)`

Set name of logging file. (".csv" file preferred)

#### `void set_player_file_name(String name)`

Set name for file that should be played.

```c++
edge_ml_earable.set_player_name("Play.wav");
```

#### `void set_recorder_file_name(String name)`

Set name of recording file. (".wav" file preferred)

#### `void setSampleRate(int sampleRate)`

Sets the sampling rate of the PDM Mic. The default value is 41667Hz.

The available sampling rates are:

- 16000Hz

#### `void setGain(int gain)`

Sets the gain of the PDM Mic. The default value is `20` and the maximum is `80`.

#### `void use_serial_data_transmission(bool enabled)`

Instead of saving the data to an SD card it can also be sent via the USB Serial port.
The raw PDM stream consisting of shorts will be sent via USB Serial if enabled.

By default seral sending is disabled.

#### `void configure_sensor(SensorConfigurationPacket& config)`

Send a configuration package from within the code.

### Sensor Configuration

Via the EdgeML pipeline or the `configure_sensor` function the sensor, PDM mic, and audio playback can be started or stopped.

The sensor IDs can be found in the "src/custom_sensor/SensorID_Earable.h".

A configuration packet is implemented as struct:

```c++
struct SensorConfigurationPacket {
    uint8_t sensorId{};
    float sampleRate{};
    uint32_t latency{};
};
```

| Byte 0    | Byte 1-4     | Byte 5-8 |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| SensorID  | Sample Rate  | Latency  |
| uint8     | float        | uint32   |

SensorID: ID of the sensor.<br>
Sample Rate: Desired sample rate.<br>
Latency: Legacy field which is mostly ignored. However, it has been repurposed as shown later.

Each sensor or audio IO can be enabled individually or together at the same time with predefined configurations.
It is recommended to use the predefined configurations.

The available predefined Sensors:
#### IMU
Sensor ID: 0

The IMU provides acceleration, gyroscope, and magnetometer values in xyz.
<br>
(max. 50Hz alone; max. 30Hz with other sensors)

| Byte 0-3 | Byte 4-7    |
|----------|-------------|
| PRESSURE | TEMPERATURE |
| float    | float       |

#### PDM MIC
Sensor ID: 2

The PDM Microphone provides audio data up to 62.5kHz.
The sample rate files of the configuration package is the audio sample rate of the sensor.

The available sampling rates are:

- 16000Hz
- 20000Hz
- 25000Hz
- 31250Hz
- 33333Hz
- 40000Hz

- 50000Hz
- 62500Hz

Most recommended are:
- 16000Hz
- 41667Hz
- 62500Hz

#### PLAYER
Sensor ID: 3

The Player sensor controls the playback of audio.
The sample rate files serves multiple purposes depending on its value:

- 0: Stops the current playback
- 1: Play the currently set file
- 2: Pause
- 3: Unpause
- 300-22000: Plays a constant tone with the sample rate representing the integer frequency. (Min. 300Hz, max. 22000kHz)

NOTE: Playing a tone takes ~1.5 seconds to initialize and may disturb a running audio recording

#### CONFIGURATION
Sensor ID: 4

With the "virtual" configuration sensor a predefined configuration of different activated sensors can be  selected.
This is NECESSARY if the audio elements are supposed to run alongside the other sensors.

The sample rate represents the chosen Configuration Number.

Here the latency field becomes important. It controls the activity of the audio playback.<br>
The following cases for latency can be distinguished:
- 0: Ignore audio player (doesn't stop current playback if active)
- 1: Stop playback
- 2: Play current file
- 3: Pause
- 4: Unpause
- 300-22000: Plays a constant tone with the sample rate representing the integer frequency. (Min. 300Hz, max. 22000kHz)

Note: Once a new configuration is received all sensors will be stopped before the new configuration is started.

Available configurations
